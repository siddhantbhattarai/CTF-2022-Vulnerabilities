**Vulnerable Ubuntu Server for CTF Practice: Full Documentation**

---

### **Objective**
To build a vulnerable Ubuntu server that simulates 99 popular CVEs from 2022 for CTF challenges and upload it to platforms such as HackTheBox and TryHackMe. The server must be initialized with all the vulnerable services running after each restart.

### **Prerequisites**
1. Ubuntu Server (20.04 or later recommended)
2. Docker and Docker Compose installed
3. Sufficient storage and memory for running multiple services

---

### **Installation Steps**

#### **1. Install Docker and Docker Compose**
Run the following commands to install Docker and Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

#### **2. Create Project Directory**
```bash
mkdir ~/vulnerable-server
cd ~/vulnerable-server
```

#### **3. Docker-Compose File Setup**
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage all vulnerable services.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:

  cve_2022_22965:
    image: vulnerables/spring4shell:latest
    container_name: cve_2022_22965
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    restart: always

  cve_2022_1388:
    image: vulnerables/f5-bypass:latest
    container_name: cve_2022_1388
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    restart: always

  cve_2022_0847:
    image: vulnerables/dirtypipe:latest
    container_name: cve_2022_0847
    volumes:
      - "/:/mnt:rw"
    privileged: true
    restart: always

  cve_2022_30190:
    image: vulnerables/follina:latest
    container_name: cve_2022_30190
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: always

  # Add all other CVE-related vulnerable services similarly
```

### **Simulated Vulnerable Services for CVEs**
Below is a list of services to be simulated along with brief descriptions and examples of available Docker images or scripts:

| CVE ID           | Vulnerability Type | Image/Service Description | Docker Image |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| CVE-2022-22965   | Injection (Spring4Shell) | Spring Boot vulnerable app | `vulnerables/spring4shell:latest` |
| CVE-2022-1388    | Identification & Auth Failures | F5 Big-IP Auth Bypass | `vulnerables/f5-bypass:latest` |
| CVE-2022-30190   | Injection (Follina) | MS Office Exploit | `vulnerables/follina:latest` |
| CVE-2022-0847    | Dirty Pipe Privilege Escalation | Kernel Exploit | `vulnerables/dirtypipe:latest` |
| CVE-2022-0778    | Cryptographic Failures | OpenSSL DoS | Custom OpenSSL Service |
| CVE-2022-21449   | Broken Access Control | Java ECDSA Signature Bypass | `vulnerables/ecdsa-bypass:latest` |

---

### **Sample Dockerfile for Custom CVE Simulations**
For vulnerabilities without a pre-existing image, create a `Dockerfile` as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    netcat \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY exploit_script.sh /usr/local/bin/exploit.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/exploit.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/exploit.sh"]
```

---

### **Script for Starting All Services**
Create a script `start_vulnerable_services.sh` to simplify the process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting vulnerable services..."

# Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d --build

echo "All services started successfully."
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x start_vulnerable_services.sh
```

---

### **Enable Auto-Start on System Boot**
To ensure services run after reboot:

1. Enable Docker service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

2. Add the script to `/etc/rc.local` for auto-execution:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add the following line before `exit 0`:
```bash
/home/username/vulnerable-server/start_vulnerable_services.sh
```
Replace `username` with your actual user.

---

### **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

#### **View Running Containers**
```bash
docker ps
```

#### **View Logs**
```bash
docker logs <container_name>
```

#### **Restart a Container**
```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```

---

### **Security Warning**
This server contains known vulnerabilities and should not be exposed to the public internet without proper network isolation and monitoring.

---

### **Final Steps**
1. Test the vulnerabilities using various tools (Metasploit, Nmap, etc.).
2. Ensure compatibility on CTF platforms (HackTheBox/TryHackMe).
3. Create clear walkthroughs and challenges based on the CVEs.

---

This documentation provides an organized approach to setting up the server with Docker Compose and includes custom setups for vulnerabilities without existing images.
